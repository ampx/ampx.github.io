## [Scheduler](https://github.com/ampx/Scheduler/)

Scheduler enables to kick off and monitor long running jobs from Grafana without a need to keep running an active web session.  If your jobs produce data, scheduler can cache that data so you can view later or share result with other users.  Scheduler can trigger external processes, like your python ETL scripts or pull data from external rest API.  Scheduler is build in modular manner to allow you to add your own custume Java datasource.  
Scheduler can also securly exchange Grafana user id with the Grafana backend using a secret key.  User id can then be used to restrict user access to a datasource, which is not possible with community edition of Grafana.
